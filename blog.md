## Introduction

Over the past decade, there has been an industry wide sure to begin integrating machine learning into their future strategies. Whether to create a new service or enhance existing services to customers, an internal tool to improve their infrastructure, or anything in between, there is no denying the value of machine learning. It has an endless variety of applications and is not limited to any specific industry. Adapting AI/ML has become a key to innovation, and it’s important to understand what goes into making this innovation possible by examining the model lifecycle. 

The data science model life cycle demonstrates the end to end process for creating machine learning models and deploying them in production. This requires many hands on the back end and isn’t a straight forward path. In this blog, we’ll walk through the ML model life cycle with an example use case created by a few data scientists at Red Hat.
